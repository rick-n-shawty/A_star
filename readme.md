## Background 
A* (A-Star) algorithm is one of the best path finding algorithms due to its completeness and efficiency. This algorithm was developed in [the Shakey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakey_the_robot) project for a mobile robot that could plan its own actions. A* is used in robotics, artificial intelligence, networks and map applicatios. Compared to [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/), A* is a "smart" algortihm due to its heuristic function.
